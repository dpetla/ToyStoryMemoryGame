# ToyStoryMemoryGame

This was the first project I did in college using Javascript. The ideia was to practice what I had learned so far, such as capturing events and changing attributes, and use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no jQuery, Bootstrap, etc).

## Objective
Create a JavaScript which will capture events and responde to them.

## Basic requirements
* capture keyboard events
* capture mouse events
* change several style attributes

### Known bugs
* some times the win game message appears before showing last card.
