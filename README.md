# ToyStoryMemoryGame

This is a simple memory game I made for my 3yr-old son to play.
This was my first project in Javascript. The ideia was to practice what I had learned only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no jQuery, Bootstrap, etc).

## Objective
Create a JavaScript which will capture and responde to them.

## Basic requirements
* capture keyboard events
* capture mouse events
* change several style attributes

### Known bugs
* message of winning game apperating before showing last card.
